Below are the third party integration:
1. SMS plan for OTP
2. Leader profiles from election commission
3. reCAPTCHA integration
4. Google Maps, OpenStreetMap integration
5. Multilingual third party translation

Below are the TBD points:
1. What is the concept of GROUP in public engagement tool?
2. What are sources of AI/ML driven election prediction?
3. What are the sources of AI/ML driven Sentiment Analysis?

LogSabha App – Key Technical & Functional Points
=======================================================

1. Performance Benchmarks
System should ensure optimized response and processing using adaptive caching and predictive load handling.
Issue reporting should complete within 45 seconds, translation accuracy should remain above 90%, and overall app response time should be under 800 milliseconds across India.

2. Legal & Accessibility Compliance
*System should strictly adhere to Government of India regulatory frameworks, including the latest IT Act, CERT-In guidelines, and Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023.
It must also comply with MeitY/NIC security standards, Election Commission (ECI) norms, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines for all public interfaces.

3. AI Meme & Infographic Creation (Compliant with Indian Norms)
System should include advanced tools for generating awareness posters, political infographics, and civic memes in compliance with Government of India communication policies and Election Commission (ECI) guidelines.
AI-assisted meme creation should allow users to generate factual, policy-based, and non-partisan visuals only.
All outputs must include automatic watermarking, moderation filters, and content validation to prevent misuse or violation of election norms.

4. Hashtag System
The system must automatically identify and display at least three trending hashtags daily based on user activity, engagement, and discussion frequency.
Each hashtag (e.g., #YogiAdityanath) should open a dynamic page showing all verified data, posts, media, and issues related to that leader or topic — functioning similar to Twitter’s topic-based feed.
AI algorithms should analyze engagement to rank hashtags contextually, ensuring relevance, transparency, and moderation of politically sensitive trends as per ECI guidelines.

5. Admin Console (Back-End Tools)
Admin section must include SLA configuration, issue triage dashboard, and management modules for polls and community groups.
AI-driven triage should automatically prioritize issues based on severity, location, and user engagement.

6. Language & Moderation System
System should include a built-in glossary for political terms, automated multilingual translation, and AI-based moderation for detecting hate, spam, or misinformation.
Contextual NLP models should analyze user sentiment, tone, and community feedback in real time.

7. Data Source Connectivity
Integration with official sources such as the Election Commission, MyNeta, and Census data.
AI-based data cleaning and mapping should maintain structured, verified, and regularly updated datasets.
Secure integration with verified SMS/WhatsApp gateways, reCAPTCHA, and encrypted mail services.

8. System Architecture
Backend should be modular (microservice-based) with GraphQL support and real-time communication via WebSockets.
AI microservices should handle translation, moderation, sentiment analysis, and geo-intelligence for constituency mapping and trend insights.

9. Analytics & Reporting
Implement an event-based data pipeline and AI-powered dashboards for real-time insights.
Use predictive analytics to identify citizen trends, policy discussions, and issue recurrence patterns.

10. Multilingual Support (AI-Enabled)
System should support all major Indian languages with AI-assisted translation, transliteration, and contextual text correction.
Include a dynamic glossary for political and governance terms to ensure accuracy and uniformity across regional communications.

11. Progressive Web App (PWA)
Web version should be PWA-ready with offline access and smart sync features.
AI-based content caching can be implemented to improve speed and accessibility in low-network regions.

12. Login & Verification System
OTP login must include reCAPTCHA and device binding.
AI-based anomaly detection should identify suspicious login behaviour or multiple fake accounts.
System should maintain 99.5% uptime, RPO of 24 hours, RTO of 4 hours, and API latency under 400 milliseconds with page load below 1 second.
Integrate AI-based monitoring tools to predict and prevent performance bottlenecks or downtime.

13. Search & Feed Structure
Feeds should support advanced filters, categories, and dynamic sorting for high engagement and better content discovery.

14. Poll System
Polls should support targeting by region, followers, or public level, with result export and fraud prevention.
AI analytics should detect voting patterns, anomalies, and sentiment trends from poll responses.

15. AI-Based Voter Mood Index (Real-Time Sentiment Dashboard)

System should include an AI-driven Voter Mood Index that continuously analyzes public sentiment on leaders, parties, and political issues.
Using NLP and engagement analytics, it should display daily mood graphs (positive / neutral / negative) for every trending topic or hashtag.
This will function as a real-time public opinion barometer, helping visualize ground sentiment across constituencies and enhancing data-driven transparency in political communication.


AI-Powered Political Hashtag Intelligence System

The app should feature an intelligent hashtag discovery system that automatically identifies and displays the top trending political hashtags daily based on user activity, engagement, and discussion frequency.
Each hashtag (for example, #YogiAdityanath) should open a dedicated dynamic page showing all verified posts, media, public discussions, and real-time sentiment related to that leader, topic, or political issue — similar to Twitter’s topic-based feed but designed specifically for India’s political ecosystem.

AI-driven algorithms should continuously analyze engagement data to rank hashtags contextually, ensuring the most relevant and credible topics appear first.
The system should also include an AI-powered Hashtag Intelligence Dashboard, displaying region-wise popularity, sentiment trends, influencer engagement, and historical performance of each topic.
This will create a live political intelligence layer, allowing real-time tracking and analysis of national and regional discussions across India.
